This inspection checks the usage of the geo directive in Nginx configuration files. It ensures that the directive is
used within the correct contexts (either http or stream). Additionally, it verifies that parameters like proxy, delete,
and ranges are only used within the http context, and that the default parameter is present inside the geo block. Errors
are highlighted if any of these conditions are violated.
