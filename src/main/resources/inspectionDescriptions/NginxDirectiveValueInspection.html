This inspection checks that directives in Nginx configuration files exist and are used in valid contexts. If a directive
is unknown or not allowed in the current context, an error message will be displayed. The inspection also verifies if
the directive can be used in its surrounding context and informs the user about the allowed contexts for each directive.
